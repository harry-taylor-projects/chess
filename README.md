# Chess
 
So far none of the chess rules have been implemented,
all you can do is drag and drop pieces.
There is currently a bug where pieces
being dragged can appear under other pieces. This is due
to the order in which the pieces are drawn.
I just need to find a tidy way to draw the dragged piece last.
Once I've fixed that bug I'll move onto programming the chess rules.
